# Challenge: Build a Movie Recommendation System

## Objective
Create a movie recommendation system that suggests films based on user preferences, leveraging web scraping, data processing, and recommendation algorithms. This project will involve multiple stages, from data collection to algorithm implementation.

## Requirements

### 1. Web Scraping
- **Task:** Scrape movie data such as titles, genres, ratings, and user reviews.
- **Tools:** Use `BeautifulSoup` or `Scrapy` to extract data from a website like IMDb or Rotten Tomatoes.
- **Deliverable:** A CSV file containing a clean dataset with relevant movie attributes.

### 2. Data Processing with Pandas
- **Task:** Clean and preprocess the scraped data.
- **Key Steps:** Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and standardize formats.
- **Deliverable:** A well-structured Pandas DataFrame ready for analysis.

### 3. Feature Engineering with Pandas and NumPy
- **Task:** Convert categorical data (like genres) into numerical features.
- **Steps:**
  - Apply one-hot encoding for categorical variables.
  - Create a content-based feature matrix.
- **Deliverable:** A matrix ready for similarity calculations.

### 4. Recommendation Algorithm
- **Task:** Implement a recommendation system using collaborative filtering or content-based filtering.
- **Steps:**
  - Use cosine similarity or another similarity measure for recommendation.
  - Implement the algorithm using Pandas and NumPy.
- **Deliverable:** A function or set of functions that generate movie recommendations based on user input.

### 5. Evaluation
- **Task:** Assess the performance of your recommendation system.
- **Key Metrics:** Use Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to evaluate accuracy.
- **Deliverable:** An evaluation report or notebook section showing how well the system performs.

## Instructions
1. Document your progress and methodology in a Jupyter notebook or a series of notebooks.
2. Include comments and markdown cells to explain your code and thought process.
3. At the end of the project, summarize your findings and any challenges you encountered.
